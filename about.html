				writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the 
				best-selling book series in history. The books are the basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval

		<font color='white' size='5'><b><p align='justify'>In 1995, Rowling finished her manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which was typed on an old manual 
		typewriter. Upon the enthusiastic response of Bryony Evens, a reader who had been asked to review the book's first three chapters, the 
		Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve 
		publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript. A year later, she was finally given the green light (and a £1,500 advance) by 
		editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London. The decision to publish Rowling's book owes much to Alice Newton, 
		the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the 
		next.[71] Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little 
		chance of making money in children's books. Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an £8,000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable 
		her to continue writing.</p>
		<p align='justify'>In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 1,000 copies, 500 of which were d
		istributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between £16,000 and £25,000. Five months later, the book won its first award, a 
		Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. In February 1998, the novel won the British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year and, later, the 
		Children's Book Award. In early 1998, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by 
		Scholastic Inc., for US$105,000. Rowling said that she "nearly died" when she heard the news. In October 1998, Scholastic published 
		Philosopher's Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a change Rowling says she now regrets and would 
		have fought if she had been in a better position at the time.[76] Rowling moved from her flat with the money from the Scholastic sale, into 
		19 Hazelbank Terrace in Edinburgh.</p>
		<p align='justify'>Its sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in July 1998 and again Rowling won the Smarties Prize.
		 In December 1999, the third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to 
		 win the award three times running. She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. 
		 In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award, though it lost the Book of the Year 
		 prize to Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.</p>
		<p align='justify'>The fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000 
		and broke sales records in both countries, with 372,775 copies of the book sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number 
		Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year. In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all records.
		 Rowling said that she had had a crisis while writing the novel and had to rewrite one chapter many times to fix a problem with the plot.
		Rowling was named Author of the Year in the 2000 British Book Awards.</p>
		<p align='justify'>A wait of three years occurred between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and 
		the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she later denied.
		Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that it could have been shorter, and that she ran out of time and energy as she tried
		to finish it.</p>
		<p align='justify'>The sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 16 July 2005. It too broke all sales records, 
		selling nine million copies in its first 24 hours of release. In 2006, Half-Blood Prince received the Book of the Year prize at the 
		British Book Awards.</p>
		<p align='justify'>The title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was announced on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly 
		Hallows. In February 2007, it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh that she had 
		finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007.[87] Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST)
		 and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time.[89] It sold 11 million copies in the first day of release in 
		 the United Kingdom and United States. The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.
		Harry Potter is now a global brand worth an estimated US$15 billion,[91] and the last four Harry Potter books have 
		consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history. The series, totalling 4,195 pages,[93] has been translated, in whole or 
		in part, into 65 languages.</p>
		<p align='justify'>The Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when 
		children were thought to be abandoning books for computers, television and video games, although it is reported that despite the huge 
		uptake of the books, adolescent reading has continued to decline.</p></font></b><br>
