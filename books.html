						Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found 
						immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well
						as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. As of February 2018, 
						the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, 
						and have been translated into eighty languages.[3] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling
						books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four
						hours of its release.</i></p>
					<p align='justify'><i>
						It is a story about Harry Potter, an orphan brought up by his aunt and uncle because his parents were killed when he was 
						a baby. Harry is unloved by his uncle and aunt but everything changes when he is invited to join Hogwarts School of 
						Witchcraft and Wizardry and he finds out he's a wizard. At Hogwarts Harry realises he's special and his adventures begin 
						when he and his new friends Ron and Hermione attempt to unravel the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone.</i></p></font>

						The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by 
						Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics,
						young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger 
						children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; 
						some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on 
						self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.</i></p>

						second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,

						and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found 
						after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione 
						investigate the attacks.</i></p>
